Specific Changes:
- Enhance equal button functionality:
  * Link calculation logic to equal button press events
  * Validate input expressions before processing
  * Handle decimal precision for scientific calculations
  * Support chained operations
- Implement error handling:
  * Detect invalid expressions
  * Show clear error messages for division by zero
  * Handle overflow and underflow conditions
  * Prevent processing incomplete expressions
- Update calculation display:
  * Show intermediate results
  * Format scientific notation appropriately
  * Display error states visually
  * Clear display on subsequent operations

Constraints:
- Maintain calculation accuracy to 10 decimal places
- Ensure response time under 100ms
- Handle numbers between 10^-100 to 10^100
- Support all scientific operations in result calculations
- Preserve operator precedence rules
- Handle memory operations correctly

Expected Output:
A fully functional equal button that correctly processes mathematical expressions and displays accurate results. Users should be able to:
- Get immediate results when pressing equal
- See properly formatted answers for all valid calculations
- Receive clear error messages for invalid operations
- Chain multiple calculations using the previous result
- View results in appropriate scientific notation when needed
