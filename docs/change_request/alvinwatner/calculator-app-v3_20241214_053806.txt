Specific Changes:
- Update number display interaction:
  * Link all numeric buttons to display updates
  * Ensure each button press immediately shows on display
  * Add visual feedback for button presses
  * Format numbers properly with decimal places

- Enhance equal button functionality:
  * Process pending mathematical operations in correct order
  * Handle operator precedence (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction)
  * Support multi-step calculations
  * Clear operation queue after showing result

- Implement calculation validation:
  * Check for division by zero
  * Verify operation sequence validity
  * Handle decimal point limitations
  * Prevent invalid number combinations

Constraints:
- Maintain 10 decimal place precision
- Keep calculation response under 100ms
- Support number range from 10^-100 to 10^100
- Handle floating point arithmetic accurately
- Preserve scientific notation for large numbers
- Ensure proper error state recovery

Expected Output:
A fully responsive calculator where:
- All numeric buttons instantly update the display
- Equal button correctly processes entire calculation sequence
- Results show immediately with proper formatting
- Error messages display clearly when calculations are invalid
- Multiple operations chain together properly
- Scientific notation displays automatically when needed
- Previous result can be used in next calculation
