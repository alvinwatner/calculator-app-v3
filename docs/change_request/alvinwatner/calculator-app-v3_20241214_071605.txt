Specific Changes:
- Adjust display background:
  * Apply dark purple color throughout calculator interface
  * Ensure consistent shading across all calculation sections
  * Maintain contrast for number visibility
  * Update button backgrounds to complement new color scheme
- Modify visual elements:
  * Adjust calculation display area tinting
  * Update separator lines between sections
  * Enhance button highlighting for better visibility
- Adapt scientific notation display:
  * Ensure readability against new background
  * Maintain clear distinction between operators and numbers

Constraints:
- Preserve existing button layout and spacing
- Maintain minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for readability
- Keep all scientific symbols clearly visible
- Ensure display area remains easily readable
- Prevent color interference with error messages
- Maintain visual hierarchy of operation elements

Expected Output:
A scientific calculator with a professional dark purple background that maintains excellent readability of all numerical displays and scientific notation. The interface should feel cohesive with the new color scheme while preserving the functional clarity needed for scientific calculations. All mathematical operations and displays should remain clearly visible and distinguishable against the darker background.
